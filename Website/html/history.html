            Starting around c. 380  or so, the Germanic tribes that had begun to inhabit much of the territory that once belonged to the Roman Empire started to abandon their paganistic beliefs for Christiananity. The Visigoths seem to have been the first to convert (their Christianization occurring in the late fifth century) and over the next four centuries the rest of the major Germanic peoples would follow suit, with the last being the Saxons in the late eighth century. It is worth mentioning that due to the limited amount of contemporary written sources covering this topic that survive today, the precise date and manner in which the tribes Christianized is often poorly understood, and as a consequence many of the specifics regarding the subject are still debated. Nevertheless, the process was both quick and thorough; indeed it would seem that by the end of the eighth century nearly all of the Germanic peoples living within the former Roman dominions had converted to Catholicism. While the specifics change tribe to tribe, analyzing each of the Germanic peoples' Christianization reveals a repeating pattern: the tribe will enter an ever-closer relationship with the Roman Empire and its Christian populace; the tribe will then convert, usually quite suddenly, to Arianism; then, the intermingling of the now-Arian Germanic people and the local Catholics in addition to the allure of befriending the Catholic world will push the Germanic tribe to fully adopt Catholicism. While not universally true, it is the goal of this paper to present and defend this thesis as a general model for how the Germanic peoples converted to Christianity.
            The beginnings of the Germanic societies' process of Christianization began with the tribes developing a more serious connection with the Roman Empire or, in the case of some of the tribes that converted after c. 476, the states that formed after the Empire’s fall. Rome had fought with Germanic peoples since before its reformation into an Empire, with the factions waging several wars against each other over the centuries. The third century saw the Roman Empire enter a period of considerable turmoil, in part because of the increasingly-incessant Germanic wars, and as such the control Rome held over its frontiers near the Rhine and Danube Rivers began to collapse. Emboldened by this, tribes like the Franks and the Alemanni broke into Roman territory and caused widespread havoc, and Gothic peoples would harry Roman lands, often taking captives during their raids. Among these captives were early Christians, and the interactions between these prisoners and their Gothic captors were one of the earliest introductions of Christianity to the Germanic world. As the seriousness of these conflicts grew, Rome soon became desperate for manpower in the region and began to hire Germanic warriors in substantial numbers in order to boost Rome’s military capabilities; by the end of the fourth century barbarians made up the majority of the Roman Army. Additionally, as Rome slowly became unable and unwilling to constantly wage war in central Europe, certain tribes were allowed to peacefully settle within Roman territory. Clearly, by the fourth century Rome and the Germanic peoples had become quite interconnected, and it was around this time that the Empire and its people converted to Christianity.
            Before their conversion, the Romans had a paganistic belief system, and while they did mandate observance of certain rituals and holidays, they generally tolerated the coexistence and practice of other religions. This would change after the adoption of Christinaity by the Empire in the early fourth century, as unlike the old polytheistic faith, Christianity doesn’t allow for the existence of other gods. Suddenly, the rejection of false beliefs and the subsequent acceptance of Christ became imperative to the majority of the Roman populace right as the migration of Germanic peoples to Roman lands was at its highest. As such, the increasing interaction between the barbarian peoples and the now-Christian Roman Empire, stemming from Germanic warriors hired to serve in the Roman Army, tribes settled within Roman lands, and tribes still fighting with Rome along the frontier, laid the foundation for the cultural exchange of religion that began the process of Christianization for essentially all of the Germanic groups.
            When the various Germanic civilizations first began to convert around the late fourth century, they converted rather quickly and, curiously, chose to adopt the heretical Arianist view on Christology which served as an introductory interpretation of Christianity. As previously mentioned, some of the prisoners captured by the Goths in their raids were Christian, and it was from the descendents of these captives that Ulfila, who would eventually become the Bishop of the Goths, was born. Ulfila would translate the Greek Bible into Gothic in the second half of the fourth century, which more or less began the Christianization of the Gothic peoples. It has been speculated that as an avid Arian, Ulfila wrote the Gothic Bible in such a way that promoted an Arian perspective of Christianity that would mesh well with pre-existing Gothic notions of religion and godhood in order to convert the Goths to Arianism. Another possible reason for the Goth’s adoption of Arianism over Catholicism is because it was the religion of the reigning Emperors during the initial Visigothic settlement in Roman territory in c. 376. Nevertheless, by the end of the fourth century the Goths had largely adopted Arian Christinaity as their religion. Likewise, the exact reason why the other Germanic tribes opted for Arianism is still unclear, though it would seem as though the heretical faith spread from the Goths, either through missionary work or through Gothic attempts to establish hegemony, to the Vandals, Burgundians, and the Sueves. Conventionally the Lombards were thought to be originally Arian as well, though recently this view has come under increasing scrutiny, and instead the Lombards probably developed a syncretistic Christian belief that included Arian concepts before completely adopting Catholicism. Despite beginning to permeate throughout the Germanic peoples almost immediately after its rejection in the Roman world at the council of Nicea in c. 325, Arianism suited the Germanic peoples’ well. It served as a gateway into the Roman world while still allowing the tribes to maintain a sense of identity, and as mentioned earlier Arian beliefs did a better job than traditional Catholicism at bridging the gap between pagan beliefs and the nature of Christ and the Trinity. It is for these reasons that some historians see Arianism as a sort of entry-level form of Christiianity that served to introduce Christian concepts to the barbarian peoples before they would eventually adopt Catholicism as the Germanic and Roman worlds slowly merged into one.
            As time went on Arianism became increasingly unsuitable for the leaders of the Germanic societies, and the effects of Romanization resulted in the Germanic peoples losing their unique identity and their Arianist beliefs with it. As the first section of this paper discussed, starting around the third century, Rome began to allow certain Germanic tribes to settle within Roman territory, and as the Romans’ control over their territory dwindled, uninvited tribes would begin to inhabit former Roman lands. The Vandals would eventually settle in North Africa, the Ostrogoths in Italy, the Visigoths in Hispania (Iberia), the Franks in Gaul, and the Lombards in Italy as well following the wars between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantine Empire. While the Empire might have fallen, the Roman people continued to exist and live their lives in a traditional Roman fashion, and as the tribes settled in these still-Roman populated lands, the Germanic people would begin to Romanize. While it may be strange that it would be the conquerors to assimilate and not the conquered, it makes more sense when one considers that in some territories, such as Hispania, it is likely that Germanic people never outnumbered the native Romans. Additionally, despite the collapse of the Empire, many former Roman provinces still had a degree of advanced societal structure and had established cultural and political aspects of their civilization remaining, such as an efficient writing system as opposed to the runes used by some of the Germanic people (who were almost exclusively illiterate) or the Roman Senate. As one can suspect, as the Germanic peoples Romanized, they would abandon their Arian faith for the Catholicism practiced by the locals.
            In addition to the natural assimilation process that affected the Germanic peoples, the various leaders and aristocrats of the Germanic civilizations often converted to Catholicism in order to better position themselves within the ever-growing power of the Christian macrocosm. Not only did the Catholic Church hold an immeasurable degree of religious authority, but its extensive network of bishops and priests often dominated the decisions of local communities, especially now that the magistrates of the Roman Empire had vanished. Additionally, when the Roman Empire collapsed the Western Catholic Church was left without a sure protectorate only for a few decades before the Frankish kingdom took the old Empire’s place as guardian of the faith. In the late fifth century, Clovis I would unite the various Frankis tribes under one kingdom, and under his rule the Franks quickly became the strongest of the Germanic civilizations and the dominant political entity in Europe. While Clovis I briefly considered adopting Arianism, he ultimately thought it was best to win the favor of the Roman Catholic world and as such took a Catholic princess as a wife before eventually getting baptized himself in c. 508. This makes the Franks unique as unlike the other Germanic peoples so far discussed, the Franks converted immediately from Paganism to Catholicism without any intermediary Arian or syncretistic phase. The Frankish Kingdom’s growing power and religious legitimacy gave more reason for the other Germanic kingdoms to enter the Catholic macrocosm. Furthermore, the Catholic Byzantines in the East continued to pose a considerable threat, and even reclaimed a large portion of the former Western Roman Empire, subsequently destroying the Vandal kingdom in North Africa (the Vandal’s persecution of Catholics was in fact a motive for the Byzantine’s conquest). As a result, the ruling class of the Germanic tribes and kingdoms remaining in the sixth century began to warm to Catholicism before many outright abandoning their Arian beliefs in an attempt to win favor and legitimacy from the Catholic Church, the Franks, and the Byzantines. The Suevic king decreed Catholicism as the kingdom’s religion in c. 569 and Visigoths officially renounced Arianism two decades later in c. 589 at the Third Council of Toledo. While the Lombards never made any formal declaration, Arianism and syncretic beliefs had died out by the seventh century.
            Due to this process of entering an ever-closer relationship with Rome and its Christian populace, followed by a conversion to Arianism or some kind of Syncretistic Chrsitianity (Franks being the exception here), before finally adopting Catholicism due to Romanization and desire to win favor with the Catholic world, by the end of the eighth century essentially all of the remaining Germanic tribes had adopted Catholic Christanity, and the few that hadn’t would be assimilated, conquered, or destroyed by a tribe that had. Through increasingly-intense interactions with the Roman Empire and its populace the Germanic tribes would be introduced to the Christian religion; this proximity and relationship with Rome is important as nations further away from the Empire in the Northern and Eastern regions of Europe wouldn’t finish their Christianizations until centuries later. The adoption of Arianism would often serve as an intermediary phase for the Germanic tribes, familiarizing them with Chrsitian concepts in a way that made sense under pre-Chrsitian Germanic concepts of religion and godhood, and allowing them to keep a unique sense of identity. Overtime, however, as the Germanic tribes settled into former Roman territory and established sedentary kingdoms, Romanization of the Germanic people would begin to occur resulting in the adoption of Catholicism over the heretical Arian beliefs. The ruling elite of the Germanic kingdom would be drawn to the power and influence of the Catholic macrocosm resulting in the conversion of Catholicism for many of the rulers and aristocracy and perhaps an official proclamation of Catholicism. This model of Christianization is not universal among the Germanic tribes; the Vandals were destroyed while they were still Arian, and the Anglo-Saxons, similar to the Franks, never had an Arian phase at all (though this does give credence to the idea that Arianism spread throughout the Germanic world with the Goths acting as the catalyst; since the Anglo-Saxons never interacted with the Goths it makes sense they wouldn’t adopt Arianism). Nevertheless, the process of Christianization for the Germanic peoples laid out in this paper generally holds and explains how and why Catholicism became the dominant religion in Germanic kingdoms and states that succeeded the Roman Empire.
