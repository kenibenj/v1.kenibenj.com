                Unlike a lot of my peers in university, my history with programming is relatively brief;
                the first real experience I had with coding was an intro to Python class I took in my senior year of high school - only about 3 years ago.
                This has its drawbacks, of course, but it does give me the unique chance to document and display my journey from a near-beginner to a full-fledged software engineer.
                While I obviously won't talk about every line of code I have ever written, I would like to show off some of the projects I have worked on, both academic and personal, as well as giving brief discussions of my thoughts during and after the development cycle.

            <h5 style="padding-left: 20px; color: rgb(80,80,80); line-height: 25px;">A CLI program that could simulate a user-given amount of games of the card game War and provide various statistics about the set of games.</h5>

                Funnily enough, War was actually my favorite card game while growing up due to its incredibly simple yet engaging premise (for a child, at least).
                As the game is pure chance and requires zero decision-making from the players, it is possible for a computer to simulate a match or set of matches in its entirety in mere moments,
                which is exactly what I had to do for the midterm of my data structures and algorithms class.
                While this project - if you could really even call it that - is incredibly straight-forward in both its design and capabilities, it was the first thing I had coded that I was actually proud to have made.
                Up until this point I still had not really developed a sense of enjoyment for coding,
                but after seeing my program take only a minute to play through a thousand matches of a cherished childhood game that normally takes dozens of minutes to play, I finally began to understand the beauty of computer science.
                In addition, this project also helped me internalize a lot of the knowledge regarding data structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) I had learned during my first year of Computer Science.

                The semester-long group assignment for my Advanced OOP class, this project had me and two other students developing a game none of us had even heard of before.
                What made this project unique was that it was meant to give us some introductory practices used in the real world:
                my team planned out how we were going to build the game by creating UML diagrams, wrote unit tests to ensure our code was proficient, and tediously wrote in-depth comments for every method &amp; class to ensure the code was well-documented.

            <p>
                For whatever reason, the Computer Science courseline contains ZERO courses dedicated to web development.
                I realized it might be a problem if I graduated with a CS degree and still didn't understand HTML, so I took it upon myself to enroll in the few web development courses ISU does offer (all listed as Informatics classes).
                Following my Spring 2022 semester, I knew the basics of front-end development but I still lacked practical expierence in designing a website from scratch.
                After seeing some friends of mine work on their own websites(), I was decided I would try to make one as well as a pet project to work on over the first half Summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                As this site is mostly a series of static informative webpages, most of the 'code' is just HTML and CSS - though a little Javascript is used here.
                All the same, creating a website without the help of a website builder has really allowed me to further my proficiency in the foundational skills needed for front-end web development
